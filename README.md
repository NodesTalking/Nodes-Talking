Nodes-Talking provides all the components needed to set up and maintain a community of Nodes. Nodes can be servers or devices or extended to be other types.  Nodes have protocols and APIS and are self-describing as they register with persistence servers (themselves nodes).  We invision uses of Nodes-Talking to include setup and adminstration of a system of remote sensors, control devices, logging servers etc but the system is flexible enough to be adapted ot other uses as well/

##Nodes-Talking System

A complete Node-Talking system consists of at least three elements, base versions of each provided:

1. A Nodes-Talking server (Nodejs based with a Mongodb implementation of the backend database)
2. Devices that register and provide protocols for communications and published APIs for interaction. (Device Test included)
3. User device to administer or interact with nodes (Android based user device included that displays Test Nodes)

## Nodes-Talking Base Technology

## Contributing

We have a loosely-coupled architecture for Nodes-Talking and encourage  contributions within each of or three main systems (Devices, Servers, User Applications). Get in touch with us. We would love to hear from you!
